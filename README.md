# Project Portal Three
Clone of the editor from the game portal 2 done with Three.js

This clone includes many user created levels from [discord](https://discord.gg/CsARjYrc), as well as a level editor based on the portal 2 level editor (currently quite buggy)

The last available version was taken down for bugfixing, more info on the discord, and also you can suggest features, report more bugs, or even just talk about the game!

You can find info on features i have already added on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Rafa_dante), you can find livestreams, devlogs and even a little trailer i made.
